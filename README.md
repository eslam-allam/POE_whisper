# POE_whisper
 simple program to notify whispers with telegram

 This program uses telegram to push notifications to you when you are away.

## Steps:
 1-download telegram and choose a username  
 2-search for @BotFather and start chatting  
 3-create a bot using bot father and save the provided bot token  
 4- search for @RawDataBot to obtain your chat ID  
 5- locate 'Client.txt' in your POE logs folder and save the absolute path (looks something like this for steam users: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt')  
 6- download and install the app and run it, the app will prompt you to enter the information you previously collected.  
 ##### The program is now up and running. if you get a 'NO OK' error upon recieving a whisper, make sure that you started a your bot (go to your bot chat in telegram) and click start. if that doesn't work then double check the bot token and chatID.  
 let me know if any inqueries, requests, or problems you might have in the issues section.  

 This is by no means an effiecient\finished product. Other C#/c++ implementations should perform alot better.  
 ##### You can access program_logs.logs file in the program folder to view all program logs(INFO, WARNINGS, ERRORS) for debugging  
 ##### Program may crash when launching POE due to an Access denied Error, this may be avoided by running as administrator. Currently working on a fix for this issue.

 ## This program is NOT endorsed by GGG or any of it's affiliates, use at your own risk after reading the POE terms and conditions.
